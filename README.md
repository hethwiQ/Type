# Truth Terminal

An anonymous, browser-based, serverless encrypted rendezvous terminal for temporary operator communication.

## Overview

Truth Terminal is a minimalist, secure communication environment. It allows operators to connect via a shared Access Phrase into a cryptographically isolated room. There are no user accounts, profiles, logs, or server-side databases storing plaintext data. Everything is designed to be disposable, ephemeral, and secure by design.

## Features

* **Access Phrase Architecture**: Entering an Access Phrase automatically joins an existing room or creates a new one instantly.
* **Client-Side Encryption**: Messages are encrypted locally in your browser using AES-GCM before ever touching the database. Firebase only stores encrypted cipher payloads.
* **Strict Ephemerality**: Rooms have a fixed 24-hour lifetime and self-destruct completely once empty or expired.
* **Active Presence Counter**: A floating operator counter tracks active connections in real time with color-coded capacity feedback.
* **Transient System Logs**: Notifications fade out automatically after a brief window to prevent screen clutter.
* **Session Restoration**: Seamlessly reconnects to your active session on browser refresh without creating duplicate operator instances.

## Quick Start Guide

1. Open the web interface in your browser.
2. Click the terminal prompt (`<?>`) or `Enter` to wake the system.
3. Enter a secure, alphanumeric **Access Phrase** (letters and numbers only).
4. Begin communicating instantly with other operators sharing the exact same phrase.

## Command Manual

Operators can execute commands directly within the terminal interface by prefixing inputs with a forward slash (`/`):

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `/help` or `/h` | Display the system manual and available commands. |
| `/status` | View live room diagnostics (Room ID, active operator count, room age, and time remaining). |
| `/purge` | Permanently wipe all message history from the current room (requires `[Y/N]` confirmation). |
| `/clear` or `/cls` | Clear the local terminal display. |
| `/admin` | Authenticate and fetch the verified creator identity payload. |
| `/exit` or `/bye` | Terminate your secure session and disconnect (requires `[Y/N]` confirmation). |

## Security & Privacy Constraints

* **No Plaintext Storage**: The server never sees your Access Phrase, your encryption keys, or your unencrypted text.
* **Automatic Purging**: Expired logs and empty rooms are automatically deleted.
* **Strict Input Rules**: Access phrases reject spaces, symbols, and special characters to ensure robust cryptographic derivation.
